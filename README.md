GrouPES is a tool that lets Teachers and Students collaborate seamlessly during the process of team formation for group projects/activities.
Teachers upload the Assignment accompanied by the constraints and requirements that need to be met. 
Students can then organize themselves into teams avoiding the need for conventional communication methods like text messages, calls and asking around.
GrouPES also eliminates the need for traditional tools like G-forms and Excel Sheets by providing the detailed list of teams and their composition within the application.
